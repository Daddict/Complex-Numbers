Vectors as we know them, have a Magnitude and a direction. in [[Complex Numbers]] however, these are called [[Modulus]], and [[Argument]], Respectively. But there is a slight different that is :

Complex numbers in the complex plane aren't a point, but rather the interval from one point to another. Since these points are intervals going from another, you might that AO is the same as OA, but looking at it from the [[Argument]] Side of things, it isn't, it's the complete polar opposite.
$$(\overrightarrow{OA}) =/= (\overrightarrow{OA})$$
# For Addition :

$(\overrightarrow{OC})$ is called the position vector of $z1 + z2$.
and $│z1 + z2│$ is the length of the diagonal of the parallelogram OACB.


# For Subtraction : 

$z1 - z2 ==> z1 + (-z2)$.
so we trace $-z2$ and add it to z1, as shown below :

Here are we can see, the argument of $z1$ is smaller than the argument of $z2$ which is why $z1 - z2$ is towards the negative.

We can take these numbers, and do the usual geometrical transformations, on them, this action is called [[Transformations in the complex plane]].
