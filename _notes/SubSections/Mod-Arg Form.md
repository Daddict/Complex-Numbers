 [[Mod-Arg Form]] is a great way to start thinking about complex numbers using two parameters, their distance from the Origin called [[Modulus]] That we note $r$ and the angle they form with the positive real axis called [[Argument]], Hence why they are called [[Mod-Arg Form]]. We note them : 
$$z = r(cos(θ) + isin(θ))$$
We can go back in forth [[Mod-Arg Form]] and Algebraic Form of Complex numbers using this method.

Multiplying by $i$ rotates us by $90°$ each time :

We can generalize this pattern into a formula by consider $z1$ and $z2$ two complex numbers, with $r1, r2$ as moduli, and $α, β$ as arguments respectively. 
With a little bit of math, and trig expansion work we get this :

Multiplying two complex numbers $z1$ and $z2$ gives us this : 
$z1z2 = r1r2 [cos(α + β) + i sin(α + β)]$

So you basically, Multiply the moduli, and add the arguments together.

But what if we multiply the same complex number repeatedly?

 Let $Z = r(cos(α) + i sin(α))$ 
 $Z^2 = r^2(cos.2(α) + isin.2(α))$
 $Z^3 = r^3(cos.3(α) + isin.3(α))$

Generalizing this gives us the following : $$Z^n=(cos.n(α) + isin.n(α))$$This is called [[De Moivre's Theorem]].
