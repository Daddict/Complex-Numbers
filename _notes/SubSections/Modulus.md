How far is something from O, it's the absolute value in the complex plane.

To calculate the modulus, you can trace your number $Z$ in the complex plane as shown here :

Now we have a right angle triangle, which we can simply use Pythagorean to get the hypothenus, which in this case will be our Modulus.

So to Calculate the modulus, we just the formula : 

$$|Z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$

It also helps knowing these :
