Given any [[Complex Numbers]] in [[Mod-Arg Form]] More accurately Polar form, such as $z = r(cos(θ) + isin(θ))$ if we raise that $Z$, $n$ times, you are raising the by n times, and multiplying the argument n times.

But what if we lose at this differently such as we go back, rather than forth, and $\sqrt[n]{Z} = \sqrt[n]{r} (cos(\frac{θ}{n}) + isin(\frac{θ}{n})$
