Let's consider $Z = 2 + 3i$ and $Z' = 1 - 4i$ 
For [[Addition]] :
$W = (x + iy) + (x' + iy')$
$W =(x + x') + i(y + y')$
$W =(2 + 1) + i(3 - 4)$
$W = 3 - i$

For [[Multiplication]] : 
$W = (x + iy) . (x' + iy')$
$W = xx' + i(xy') + i(yx') - yy'$
$W = (xx' - yy') + i(xy' + yx')$
$W = 14 + i(-5)$
$W = 14 - 5i$

For [[Conjugates]] : 
In normal numbers, conjugates get rid of the rational part when added or multiplied on each other.
In the complex world however, they help us remove the imaginary part of a number so
$z + z̅ = 2x ==> 2.Re(z)$ 
$z . z̅ = x^2 + y^2$

For [[Division]] : 
In normal numbers, when you have 
$$\frac{1}{2 - \sqrt{3}} + \frac{1}{4 - \sqrt{5}}$$
You will need to get rid of the square roots in the bottom by rationalizing them

In complex numbers, when you have
$$W = \frac{2 + 3i}{1 - 4i}$$

You will instead of rationalize, "Realize" the denominator by doing this

$$W = \frac{2 + 3i}{1 - 4i} . \frac{1 + 4i}{1 + 4i} = -\frac{10}{17} + i\frac{11}{17} $$
