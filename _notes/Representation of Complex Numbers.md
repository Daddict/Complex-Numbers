With $z = x + iy$ (x and y are horizontal and vertical displacements)

But we can also think about them as a rocket, where we go from $O$ turn with an angle $θ$ which is the [[Argument]] and then shoot by a distance of $r$ which is the radius and the [[Modulus]], giving us it's coordinates
$rcos(θ)$ as $x$ and $rsin(θ)$ as $y$

so we can then replace our expression 
$$z = x + iy$$
to make it :
$z = r.cosθ + i.r.sinθ$
factorize and then get the following : 
$$z = r(cos(θ) + isin(θ))$$
This is called [[Mod-Arg Form]]
