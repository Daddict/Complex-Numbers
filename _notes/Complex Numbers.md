[Complex numbers] are numbers that are written in the algebraic form of $Z = x + iy$

With "$x$" being the [[real part]], "$y$" the [[imaginary part]], and "$i = âˆš-1$" the imaginary unit. 
$Z$ is purely real if $Im(Z)=0 => Z=x$ 
$Z$ is purely imaginary if $Re(Z)=0 => Z=y$.

This enables us to start manipulating complex numbers, and doing [[Complex Arithmetic]]
This also enables us to start thinking about [[Complex Numbers as Vectors]].
Once we know how to think about [[Complex Numbers as Vectors]] we can get to [[Representation of Complex Numbers]].
